Project Requirement:
This project aims to analyse a file with a large body of Text and to count number of occurance of the words. 
This Application counts the words in a file and saves the words and counts to a MongoDB server.

Project

1. Here I have used a xml file as example  and converted to JSON object and inserted into MongoDB Server with words and count.
2. This project will accept xml as input and converts the xml to json and stores in json.txt and import the source and count values to 
MongoDB Server.
3. I have not created any jar file or cmd line argument to execute this application we can easily run as java application .
4. Further Developments have to be done to accept  command line argument and convert to a jar file and execute it.
5. Example new.xml and json.txt is availble in bin folder.
6. Keep the files in local path and execute the application.

7. Aggregate Framework and Map Reduce have to used for word counts and to get the most and least used words in large text file.
